RetroAchievements Emulator Requirements:
* If the emulator does not support a feature, the requirement is automatically met. This is primarily a set of
  guidelines to ensure the interaction between the emulator and the toolkit is consistent between emulators.
* If the system is supported by RetroArch, explain why a standalone emulator is desirable. RetroArch support is 
  preferred as it is usable by more players (i.e. not just Windows users), and adding support to RALibRetro for 
  an additional core is much easier than overhauling an entire emulator.

[ ] Game Identification
  [ ] Hash method documented and approved
  [ ] If emulator supports dynamic patching [i.e. ips], hash is calculated after applying patch
  [ ] Hash ignores any persistent save data [SRAM]
  [ ] Game can be properly identified (RA_OnLoadNewRom and/or RA_IdentifyROM + RA_ActivateGame)
  [ ] Unidentified game provides some descriptor [typically filename] to unknown game dialog (RA_InstallSharedFunctions>RA_GetEstimatedGameTitle)
  [ ] Unidentified game provides list of known games for console (RA_SetConsoleID - which is usually called by RAIntegration in the emulator registration)
[ ] Emulator
  [ ] DLL is downloaded if not available (RA_Init - new EmulatorID enum value may be needed in RA_Interface.h)
  [ ] RetroAchievements menu is visible (RA_CreatePopupMenu) and functional (RA_InvokeDialog)
  [ ] RetroAchievements menu updates when logging in/out (RA_InstallSharedFunctions>RA_RebuildMenu)
  [ ] Login dialog displayed on first run or auto-login on future runs (RA_AttemptLogin)
  [ ] Title includes logged in user (RA_UpdateAppTitle)
  [ ] RALog.txt ends with "Shutdown complete" after closing emulator (RA_Shutdown)
  [ ] Full-window overlay can be displayed (RA_SetPaused)
  [ ] Full-window overlay can be navigated (RA_NavigateOverlay)
  [ ] Full-window overlay navigation uses player's custom controller bindings, not hard-coded inputs.
  [ ] Closing the full-window overlay unpauses the emulator (RA_InstallSharedFunctions>RA_CauseUnpause)
  [ ] Overlay is still functional when toggling full-screen mode (RA_UpdateHWnd)
  [ ] Resetting the emulator disables any active popups/leaderboards (RA_OnReset)
  [ ] Performance of emulator (without any debugging windows open) should not be noticeably different than the source emulator at 100% speed
  [ ] Emulator must perform at intended framerate on a PC that could have been purchased at a retail store within the last four years.
[ ] Emulated System
  [ ] Memory mapping method is documented and approved (RA_InstallMemoryBank)
  [ ] Modifying memory affects the game (RA_InstallMemoryBank>pWriter)
[ ] Achievements/Leaderboards/Rich Presence
  [ ] Achievements can be created
  [ ] Achievements trigger (RA_InstallMemoryBank>pReader, RA_DoAchievementsFrame)
  [ ] Achievement trigger displays notification
  [ ] Achievement can pause emulator [Pause on Reset, Pause on Trigger] (RA_InstallSharedFunctions>RA_CausePause)
  [ ] Achievements are not processed when emulator is paused [HitCount for true condition does not increment] (RA_DoAchievementsFrame not called when paused)
  [ ] When using frame advance, achievements are only processed when the frame is advanced.
  [ ] Changing the current game prompts the user to save modifications (RA_ConfirmLoadNewRom)
    [ ] Choosing not to save modifications aborts changing the current game.
  [ ] Closing the emulator prompts the user to save modifications (RA_ConfirmLoadNewRom)
    [ ] Choosing not to save modifications aborts closing the emulator.
  [ ] Closing the current game prompts the user to save modifications (RA_ConfirmLoadNewRom)
    [ ] Choosing not to save modifications aborts closing the current game.
  [ ] Closing the current game clears the list of achievements for the game (RA_ActivateGame(0))
[ ] Softcore
  [ ] Save states can be created
  [ ] Save states can be loaded
  [ ] HitCounts persist with save state (RA_OnSaveState, RA_OnLoadState)
  [ ] Speed may be adjusted above 100% [framerate higher than normal]
  [ ] Speed may be adjusted below 100% [framerate lower than normal]
  [ ] Fast-forward [removing frame limiter] is allowed
  [ ] Rewind is allowed
  [ ] Frame advance is allowed
    [ ] Overlay should not be displayed when using frame advance (don't call RA_SetPaused)
  [ ] Recording is allowed
  [ ] Recording playback is allowed
  [ ] Switching to Hardcore resets the emulator (RA_InstallSharedFunctions>RA_ResetEmulation)
  [ ] Switching to Hardcore resets the emulator speed to 100%
  [ ] Switching to Hardcore closes any emulator specific tools for viewing/modifying memory
  [ ] Switching to Hardcore disables any enabled cheats
[ ] Hardcore
  [ ] Save states can be created
  [ ] Save states cannot be loaded [prompt to switch to softcore (RA_WarnDisableHardcore)]
  [ ] Speed may be adjusted above 100%
  [ ] Speed cannot be adjusted below 100%
  [ ] Fast-forward is allowed
  [ ] Rewind is not allowed
  [ ] Frame advance is not allowed
  [ ] Recording is allowed
  [ ] Recording playback is not allowed
  [ ] Switching to Softcore does not reset the emulator
  [ ] Emulator specific tools for viewing/modifying memory are not allowed [prompt to switch to softcore optional]
  [ ] Emulator specific tools for supporting cheats are not allowed [prompt to switch to softcore optional]
  [ ] Ensure any features not allowed in hardcore are disabled both from menu items and hotkeys
[ ] After approval
  [ ] Version generated from git tag
  [ ] Zip file needs to be built - should contain emulator, default Overlay directory, and any supplemental files needed by the emulator
  [ ] Backend (to be done by the RAWeb team)
    [ ] Add the emulator's console ID as a "valid" console, so new achievements can be promoted to the Core set (RAWeb:lib/database/game.php>isValidConsoleId).
    [ ] Add the emulator's enum (get the number from RAInterface.h and add it in RAWeb:src/Emulators.php)
    [ ] dorequest.php>latestclient needs to map to LatestXXXVersion.html file when it receives either emulator ID or console ID.
    [ ] Add link to the new system game list in RAWeb:lib/dynrenderer.php>RenderToolbar.
    [ ] Add an entry for the emulator in RAWeb:public/reportissue.php, so people can choose it when opening tickets.
    [ ] Upload zip file to the server
    [ ] Create the LatestXXXVersion.html page.
    [ ] Add a link to the zip file and show the latest emulator's version in RAWeb:public/download.php
